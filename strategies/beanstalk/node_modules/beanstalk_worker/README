Beanstalk Worker for Node.js
============================

version 0.2.0

Simple BeanstalkWorker and BeanstalkWorkerCluster objects for connecting to a beanstalkd queue and running jobs.

requires node-beanstalk-worker

Try it:

In one console:
$ node test/produce_test_jobs.js

In another:
$ node bin/worker.js

===

NPM:

$ npm install beanstalk_worker 

 -> Creates nbworker as an executable symlink to bin/worker.js (Will also install the client lib)

You can pass this the path to a config file to specify how many client connections to open, where the handlers for jobs are, and so forth:

$ nbworker /etc/npworler/conf/example.js


/etc/nbworker/conf/example.js:
---
module.exports = {

  workers: 3,
  server: '127.0.0.1:11300',
  tubes: ['external'],
  ignore_default: true,
  handlers: ['../handlers/test', '../handlers/http_request']

};
console.log('Loaded conf/example.js config');
