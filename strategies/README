This is where you should put your persistence and worker strategies.
They will be made available as fields on the top level daida module.

They should be modules themselves following the "folders as modules"
idiom in the node.js fashion. 

The folders they are contained in should have the same name as the 
module they contain preferably all lower cased. The module name 
should be CamelCased however.

You can symlink modules into this folder if you install them via
npm. The default modules are done this way.

More info about node.js "folders as modules"" style available here:
