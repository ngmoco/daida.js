/**
 * The Supervisor object
 *
 * It allows you to start a bunch of workers and
 * hand them jobs and either start their timers immediately
 * a la runJob() below. OR you can allow for a bunch of jobs
 * to be added and then start all of their timers at once (see runAll() below)
 * OR you can allow for the supervisor to poll for new jobs being added and
 * start their timers as they come in (see runAllAndPoll below). The latter 2
 * are handy if you want to defer staring job's timers until a certain point
 * in time aka when the system is not under load.
